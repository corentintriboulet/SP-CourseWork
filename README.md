# SP-CourseWork \
Signal Processing course work at Centrale Lyon 

## Objectives \

Signal processing consists of all the techniques used to describe the acquisition, storage, modification, coding and transmission
of information. Faced with the mass of the signals that need to be processed, often in real time, technological systems of great
complexity have invaded our society. In response to current challenges, powerful scientific methods have been developed to
manage such complexity. The mastery of these methods becomes inescapable in the practice of the engineer whatever the field
to which it is destined. The objective of this course is to present the preliminary bases for the acquisition and mastery of these
methods and to illustrate them by their application.

## Keywords : \

Deterministic and random signals, Analog and digital signals, Time domain and frequency domain analysis, Fourier
and Laplace transforms, Analog and digital filtering, Sampling, Discrete Fourier transform, Signal modeling

## Programme \
1) Modelling and characterizing a signal: time domain and frequency domain analysis \
2) Modelling and characterizing a system: convolution and filtering
3) Correlation functions and spectrum density
4) From analog signals to digital signals
5) Digital filtering
6) From deterministic signals to random signals
